## My process
I started building the html structure where I used div, h2 and h3.
Then go to the css, in this case I used background color, margin, padding and Flexbox
I didn't see that was important use "mediasqueries"

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development
Keep learning and practice Flexbox
